# DSA-MASTERY
Structured Data Structures &amp; Algorithms practice with detailed notes, clean implementations, and pattern-based categorization. Solving problems from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and beyond with focus on understanding patterns, not just quantity.

# DSA Mastery ðŸš€

This repository documents my journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms**.  
Unlike random problem-solving, this repo is **pattern-focused**: each problem is studied, solved, and connected to its underlying idea.

## Structure
- `problems/` â†’ Code solutions categorized by topic.
- `patterns/` â†’ Reusable templates (sliding window, binary search on answer, BFS, etc.).
- `notes/` â†’ Short markdown notes summarizing triggers, complexities, and edge cases.
- `utils/` â†’ Helper scripts (input parsing, testing, templates).

## Practice Platforms
- LeetCode
- GeeksforGeeks
- Others (Codeforces, HackerRank)

## Goals
- Solve **200â€“250 canonical problems** with deep mastery.
- Build a **pattern recognition system** for interviews.
- Maintain clean, efficient code with documented variations.
